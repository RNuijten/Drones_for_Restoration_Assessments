Fine scale plant community assessment in coastal meadows using UAV based multispectral data,Reference 1,"Increasing levels of species diversity correspond to increased spectral diversity, as has been shown in previous studies. However, after reaching the 506 maximum level of species diversity, the curve turns negative indicating an increase in spectral diversity as Shannon’s diversity index decreases. This variation in the relationship can be attributed to two phenomena. On one hand, the sensitivity of spectral diversity to biomass (Fig. 6a) could mask the effect of species diversity. This is indicated by the fact that all the plotted points around the negative section of the loess fitted curve in Fig. 6b correspond to Reed Swamp, which is characterized by a high biomass and a relatively low level of species diversity. On the other hand, the very high spatial resolution imagery provided by sensors mounted on UAVs may lead to artefacts. For instance, in communities characterized by tall vegetation such as Reed Swamp, some pixels may fall in areas with direct sunlight 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 while others may fall in shaded areas or gaps between individual plants (Nagendra et al., 2010), therefore increasing the spectral variability of the sample.

Forest restoration monitoring through digital processing of high resolution images,Reference 1,"According to the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (2013) and Viani et al. (2017), after four years of restoration implementation the canopy cover should achieve at least 70% to be capable to reduce invasive grass cover and to facilitate tree establishment. Our study area has not reached the desired value yet, probably due to the planting methodology, which used lines of early seral tree species interspersed with late seral species that have slower development and higher mortality. The high grass cover found in this study can be explained by the fact that the project area was covered by degraded pastures dominated by Urochloa decumbens before restoration activities and by the short time period since the restoration process has started. The invasive grass cover also competes with native tree seedlings species impeding or hindering their growth (Rocha-Nicoleite et al, 2017), and this can be seen in our restoration area. Bare soil cover was not high, but when it occurs in large areas, it induces soil erosion and nutrient loss (Muñoz-Rojas et al., 2016) that call for further restoration interventions. According to the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (2013) and Viani et al. (2017), after checking the land cover indicators, a ﬁeld ecological monitoring (phase II) has to be done in areas where canopy cover is greater than 70%. This monitoring is to verify species composition indicators (e.g. richness, density, regeneration) based on ﬁeld sampling and it will guide adaptive management techniques aiming to correct the restoration trajectory of the areas if necessary. This two-step evaluation (remote sensing and ﬁeld monitoring) should reduce the costs associated with monitoring, since it will not be necessary to measure ﬁeld indicators in all areas.

Can functional leaf traits be used for monitoring wetland restoration~ A comparison between commonly used monitoring metrics and functional leaf traits,Reference 1,"Mean C is a metric used in Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA), a standardized method for calculating metrics that reflect the quality of an area based on plant species composition (Swink & Wilhelm 1979). Mean C is the average of individual species’ coefficients of conservatism (C-values), scores ranging from 0 to 10 that have been assigned to all plant species occurring within a state or region by botanists with regional or statewide expertise. C-values serve as proxies for species’ responses to anthropogenic disturbance, with higher scores assigned to species that are restricted to undegraded natural areas (Taft et al., 1997). Mean C was calculated using values assigned to Illinois species by Taft et al. (1997). Floristic Quality Index (FQI), or mean C multiplied by the square root of species richness, was considered but ultimately not used because it was redundant with richness and mean C. We used P. arundinacea cover as a proxy for non-native species cover because it was the dominant invasive species at these wetlands, and many other non-native species that were documented are naturalized and not known to aggressively compete with native species. We quantified canopy cover in each plot using a concave spherical crown densiometer to account for the impact that variation in sunlight may have on the plant community. Canopy cover readings were taken at each corner of the plot (NW, NE, SW, SE) and then averaged for an estimate of the whole plot cover.

C-values serve as proxies for species’ responses to anthropogenic disturbance, with higher scores assigned to species that are restricted to undegraded natural areas (Taft et al., 1997). Mean C was calculated using values assigned to Illinois species by Taft et al. (1997). Floristic Quality Index (FQI), or mean C multiplied by the square root of species richness, was considered but ultimately not used because it was redundant with richness and mean C.

We have adapted DASM methods for landscape-scale inventories, small-scale statistically designed monitoring to assess patch dynamics and temporal trends among the different regions within the landscape, and detailed mapping to support treatment activities of individual managers. Together, these three approaches for monitoring exotic plants work in combination to reduce management costs.

Forest restoration monitoring through digital processing of high resolution images,Reference 2,"According to the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (2013) and Viani et al. (2017), after four years of restoration implementation the canopy cover should achieve at least 70% to be capable to reduce invasive grass cover and to facilitate tree establishment. Our study area has not reached the desired value yet, probably due to the planting methodology, which used lines of early seral tree species interspersed with late seral species that have slower development and higher mortality. The high grass cover found in this study can be explained by the fact that the project area was covered by degraded pastures dominated by Urochloa decumbens before restoration activities and by the short time period since the restoration process has started. The invasive grass cover also competes with native tree seedlings species impeding or hindering their growth (Rocha-Nicoleite et al, 2017), and this can be seen in our restoration area. Bare soil cover was not high, but when it occurs in large areas, it induces soil erosion and nutrient loss (Muñoz-Rojas et al., 2016) that call for further restoration interventions. According to the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (2013) and Viani et al. (2017), after checking the land cover indicators, a ﬁeld ecological monitoring (phase II) has to be done in areas where canopy cover is greater than 70%. This monitoring is to verify species composition indicators (e.g. richness, density, regeneration) based on ﬁeld sampling and it will guide adaptive management techniques aiming to correct the restoration trajectory of the areas if necessary.

Fine scale plant community assessment in coastal meadows using UAV based multispectral data,Reference 1,"Increasing levels of species diversity correspond to increased spectral diversity, as has been shown in previous studies. However, after reaching the 506 maximum level of species diversity, the curve turns negative indicating an increase in spectral diversity as Shannon’s diversity index decreases. This variation in the relationship can be attributed to two phenomena. On one hand, the sensitivity of spectral diversity to biomass (Fig. 6a) could mask the effect of species diversity. This is indicated by the fact that all the plotted points around the negative section of the loess fitted curve in Fig. 6b correspond to Reed Swamp, which is characterized by a high biomass and a relatively low level of species diversity. On the other hand, the very high spatial resolution imagery provided by sensors mounted on UAVs may lead to artefacts. For instance, in communities characterized by tall vegetation such as Reed Swamp, some pixels may fall in areas with direct sunlight 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 while others may fall in shaded areas or gaps between individual plants (Nagendra et al., 2010), therefore increasing the spectral variability of the sample.

We have adapted DASM methods for landscape-scale inventories, small-scale statistically designed monitoring to assess patch dynamics and temporal trends among the different regions within the landscape, and detailed mapping to support treatment activities of individual managers. Together, these three approaches for monitoring exotic plants work in combination to reduce management costs. Lowand-slow grid and outlier monitoring provides the most precise possible guidance to contractors and supports determinations of treatment effectiveness.

We have adapted DASM methods for landscape-scale inventories, small-scale statistically designed monitoring to assess patch dynamics and temporal trends among the different regions within the landscape, and detailed mapping to support treatment activities of individual managers. Together, these three approaches for monitoring exotic plants work in combination to reduce management costs. Lowand-slow grid and outlier monitoring provides the most precise possible guidance to contractors and supports determinations of treatment effectiveness.

Native species replacement by invasive plants was observed between S1 and S2 (0–10 years), but longer-term investigations (S1 to S3, 0–20 years) revealed invasive plant replacement by native species.

Monitoring ecological characteristics of a tallgrass prairie using an unmanned aerial vehicle,Reference 1,"This is illustrated by the deviations of excluded sites TCR and WH, which produced zero acceptable predictions. Although we tried to evenly pair sites by restoration age, TCR and WH are unique in that TCR is the only remnant in the study and WH is the only restoration closely adjacent to savanna habitats, with some level of woody encroachment. Because these two were randomly chosen to be left out ofthe training data, they were not properly represented, and our models were unable to make good predictions given the site conditions. In contrast, CCWE and HPW contain site conditions well represented throughout the model and had at least one acceptable prediction given our condition of falling below the cross-validation mRMSE. Unsurprisingly, this means that sites that generally are more similar to those in the training set will be better predicted by resulting models.

Characteristics relating to plant communities and soil properties can provide restoration practitioners with insight into how these variables are impacted by management decisions. For example, in tallgrass prairies, bison reintroductions are being used to promote more heterogeneous and diverse restorations through increasing forb abundance thought to be driven by a decrease in graminoid cover (Biondini et al. 1999; Knapp et al. 1999; Eby et al. 2014). UAV-derived models could allow practitioners to quantify the “success” of bison reintroductions by monitoring changes in graminoid cover. Further, soil potassium has been shown to correlate with the distribution of C3 and C4 plant communities and some forb genera (Barnes et al. 1983; Parker et al. 1993).

Fine scale plant community assessment in coastal meadows using UAV based multispectral data,Reference 1,"Increasing levels of species diversity correspond to increased spectral diversity, as has been shown in previous studies. However, after reaching the 506 maximum level of species diversity, the curve turns negative indicating an increase in spectral diversity as Shannon’s diversity index decreases. This variation in the relationship can be attributed to two phenomena. On one hand, the sensitivity of spectral diversity to biomass (Fig. 6a) could mask the effect of species diversity. This is indicated by the fact that all the plotted points around the negative section of the loess fitted curve in Fig. 6b correspond to Reed Swamp, which is characterized by a high biomass and a relatively low level of species diversity. On the other hand, the very high spatial resolution imagery provided by sensors mounted on UAVs may lead to artefacts. For instance, in communities characterized by tall vegetation such as Reed Swamp, some pixels may fall in areas with direct sunlight 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 while others may fall in shaded areas or gaps between individual plants (Nagendra et al., 2010), therefore increasing the spectral variability of the sample.

These results suggest that UAS imagery can be a useful tool for identifying the extent of Phragmites under a range of conditions, which can be useful for ecological monitoring.

Fine scale plant community assessment in coastal meadows using UAV based multispectral data,Reference 3,"Increasing levels of species diversity correspond to increased spectral diversity, as has been shown in previous studies. However, after reaching the 506 maximum level of species diversity, the curve turns negative indicating an increase in spectral diversity as Shannon’s diversity index decreases. This variation in the relationship can be attributed to two phenomena. On one hand, the sensitivity of spectral diversity to biomass (Fig. 6a) could mask the effect of species diversity. This is indicated by the fact that all the plotted points around the negative section of the loess fitted curve in Fig. 6b correspond to Reed Swamp, which is characterized by a high biomass and a relatively low level of species diversity. On the other hand, the very high spatial resolution imagery provided by sensors mounted on UAVs may lead to artefacts. For instance, in communities characterized by tall vegetation such as Reed Swamp, some pixels may fall in areas with direct sunlight 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 while others may fall in shaded areas or gaps between individual plants (Nagendra et al., 2010), therefore increasing the spectral variability of the sample.

Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to assess the rehabilitation performance of open cut coal mines,Reference 1,". A time-series of status and land-cover maps may also be used for negotiated residual risk assessments at the relinquishment stage (Lamb et al, 2015), to determine the residual risk payment by the leasing company for covering potential long-term costs of managing the final site. As this payment depends on the level of demonstrated certainty of landforms remaining stable and the sustainability of the site, a time-series of UAV based status and land-cover maps with complete spatial coverage may provide more convincing evidence than field data, covering selected parts of a mine rehabilitation site. Regulators may often lack adequate tools to assess compliance and sustainability of rehabilitation. Hence, this research may also support regulatory authorities that require validation of rehabilitation achievements claimed by mining companies. The main benefit of the developed approach is that it can be used by both mining companies and regulators at different spatial scales, for both small and large polygons, as long as the specific thresholds for the indicators outlined in Table 2 are adjusted accordingly.",Drone studies,GENERAL,TEMP (Temporal resolution of information),TEMP - More than 1 but unspecified
Evaluation of a Regional Monitoring Program's Statistical Power to Detect Temporal Trends in Forest Health Indicators,Reference 1,"In addition, although more difﬁcult logistically to implement, we could use what we have learned about how 1 3 total variance is partitioned for these ‘‘low power’’ indicators and modify the sampling design in such a way to reduce certain sources of variation. In our case, the primary source of variation for ‘‘low power’’ indicators was spatial variability. Therefore, additional sites could be added or a spatial stratiﬁcation scheme could be implemented (e.g., develop a landscape-based classiﬁcation scheme that groups similar plots and then look for trend within those vegetation classes). These power estimates",d studies,GENERAL,TEMP (Temporal resolution of information),TEMP - More than 1 but unspecified
Threshold dynamics in plant succession after tree planting in agricultural riparian zones,Reference 1,"In an innovative adaptation, species scores along the PRC axis were averaged for meaningful ecological groups, to bring further mechanistic insights into successional patterns. Such an understanding can be taken a step further when environmental variables are monitored simultaneously with plant communities. By comparing the temporal dynamics of environmental variables with species turnover, it is possible to easily discriminate the primary drivers of plant succession, as shown here for light availability. Restoration researchers and practitioners are thus encouraged to collect both species and environmental data in restored and reference habitats over time, in order to perform time-series analyses",d studies,GENERAL,TEMP (Temporal resolution of information),TEMP - More than 1 but unspecified
